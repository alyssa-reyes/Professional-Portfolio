            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am an environmental scientist with a strong foundation in ecology, geospatial science, and science communication. I graduated from Cal Poly Humboldt with 
				a B.S. in Biology (Ecology emphasis) and with a Geospatial Information Sciences Certificate. I am currently working towards my M.S. in Environmental Sciences at 
				Oregon State University. I am passionate about understanding and communicating how human activities shape ecosystems. I am motivated by meaningful work that blends science, 
				communication, and community engagement. Whether I’m creating a map, conducting field research, or interpreting a trail-side discovery for visitors, 
				I aim to help people feel more connected to nature and empowered to support environmental stewardship.
